# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

# Common issues
Before saying "it doesn't work" with web development in general, please consult this [common issues document](common-issues.md). It is the solution to 95% of the problems I've seen young web devs have when working with web components, terminal, VS code and javascript/html/css more broadly.

# Past weeks
- [Week 1 & 2](sp25/week-1-2.md)
- [Week 3](sp25/week-3.md)
- [Week 4](sp25/week-4.md)

# Grading note
Going forward TAs are going to be instructed to do the following:
- Does it say "Add files via upload" for every file
- Does it look nothing like the repos we are doing in class week to week
- **it is not a valid submission and expect a 0**.
- This is not a "Code how ever I feel like class" nor is it "Copy directions into chatgpt and see what comes out class"
- We are learning modern front end web development while writing using the Lit library to understand the current and future-proof method of component architecture
- Literally the whole course is this way going forward, get on track now.
