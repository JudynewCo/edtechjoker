# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

# Common issues
Before saying "it doesn't work" with web development in general, please consult this [common issues document](common-issues.md). It is the solution to 95% of the problems I've seen young web devs have when working with web components, terminal, VS code and javascript/html/css more broadly.

# Week 11,12,13 - Project 1
We are going to work on Project 1. This is going to still involve time coming to class, attendence, and check ins weekly. You will have 3 weeks to work on and complete Project 1 to the best of your ability. You must pick between one of two options. Once again, working with people around you is the best way to arrive at the optimal solution. This one also has clearer lines of separation (both involve 2 elements, a list, a functional element as well as a visual element).

While not group work persay, if you want to break the work up with people you trust then you are free to do so just like we did last time. You are all still expected to turn in your own repo, your own work, and it is to be your work.

Project 1 is worth 12% of your overall grade. You will be judged largely on meeting the requirements. Read the requirements of each carefully. Both have a tricky design implication as well as a tricky functional implication (whether that's validation or passing design down to children). These are very similar in scope even if they look different. They are both actual needs and the goal is to get these important pieces added both to DDD and the HAX editor so that content can be produced more rapidly that matches the design spec.

## Options
- [Vertical steps list element #2256](https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/issues/2256)
- [Campus card list #2257](https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/issues/2257)

# Check in 1 requirement
- You have started on the element in question. There is code on github / vercel pipeline setup. It is using the HAX tooling. **it is named correctly**
- You have started to work through the code.
- You are to submit a link to your git repo
- You are to submit a picture of how you plan to make this. Sketch, proposed html structure, etc. how ever you concieve of the visual issue as opposed to just the screen shot. What is the screen shot made up of and how?
- Also you are to submit answers to the following in Canvas:
  - What you've done so far
  - What you are planning to do next
  - Current issues you are having

Good luck!
