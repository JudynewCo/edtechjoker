# Glossary

Define each term below by writing a paragraph explaining what it is and why it's important for web development. Include 2-3 relevant links for more information.

## Web Components
Web Components are a set of standardized browser features (Custom Elements, HTML Templates) that let developers create reusable, encapsulated UI elements. They’re important because they provide a framework to build components that work across different libraries and projects, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

## Lit
Lit is a lightweight JavaScript library for building fast, reusable Web Components. It simplifies creating Custom Elements by handling rendering, reactivity, and updates efficiently. Lit is important in web development because it bridges the gap between low-level Web Components and modern developer productivity, making it easier to build scalable, modular front-end systems.

## NPM
NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It lets developers install, share, and manage reusable code packages. In web development, NPM is crucial for handling project dependencies, simplifying updates, and enabling teams to leverage a massive ecosystem of open-source tools and libraries.

## Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, typically on servers. This is important for web development because it enables developers to use the same language (JavaScript) for both client- and server-side development, powering modern web apps, APIs, and development tools.

## JavaScript
JavaScript is the core programming language of the web, enabling dynamic behavior in websites and web applications. It’s essential because it allows developers to create interactive UI, handle user input, update content without reloading pages (AJAX), and work with modern frameworks, APIs, and back-end environments like Node.js.
